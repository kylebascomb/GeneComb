Future Features
===============

While GeneComb aims to be a simple library, there is always room for improvement and additional features. The features that
are currently in the pipeline are:

* Downloading sequences directly from NCBI using Accession IDs

* GeneComb database integrations

* Motif based Functions


We encourage you to come to the GitHub repo and help contribute to the project! We appreciate help from anyone! Whether you have years 
of experience in bioinformatics, or you are just curious about the field, we welcome everyone to help out with GeneComb.
